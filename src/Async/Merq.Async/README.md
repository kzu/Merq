Merq Async Interfaces
====================

The core interfaces are the stable contracts for asynchronour execution
and should therefore be quite stable.

Therefore, the contracts version information is derived from a GitInfo.txt 
in this project. The implementations may be versioned differently.

If contracts are updated, the GitInfo.txt Major or Minor segments must be 
updated, since the build/commits is fixed at the value of zero at the 
assembly version level.
